 This implementation applies a proposed translations changeset, in the format defined by @axhxrx/internationalization-format-converter, to the checked out repo. This is obviously a very specific use case, but it is the first use case for which this library was developed.

 In the future, though, we could make this more generic by allowing the user of this lib to override this, to apply other kinds of changesets.
